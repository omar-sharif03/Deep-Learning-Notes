# Deep-Learning-Notes

I have made these notes when I took [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/ELLF6SH732TL) on Coursera. This specialization is conducted by **Andrew Ng** (my favourite) and interested ones should take this specialization. I believe that it will give you necessary knowledge and confidence to do some (research & projects) in this feild.

N.B: I have made these notes roughly so it might have some inconsistencies. Hope you will consider.
